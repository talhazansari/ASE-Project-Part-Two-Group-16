In the first line we are reading the geometry of the postal codes in berlin

Line 14:
Reading the charging stations in Berlin (Adress, Name, Connector Type, etc.)

Line 15:
Preprocessing the data:
    - Selecting only the columns we need
    - Renaming the columns
    - Parsing the coordinates
    - Filtering for Berlin only (we are only interested in Berlin)
    - Sort by postal code
    - Appending geo data (polygon of the PLZ)
    - Converting to GeoDataFrame

Line 16:
Counting the number of charging stations per postal code

Line 18:
Reading in the population data

Line 19:
Same preprocessing as in line 15

Line 21:
Starting the streamlit app with the data we have prepared (two geo data frames)

# Interpretation of results

We have concluded that the inner city of Berlin has a suficient amount of charging stations. The outer parts of Berlin have a lack of charging stations. Also in the east of Berlin where a large amount of people live, there are not enough charging stations. In the outer west (Spandau) there are also not enough charging stations.
